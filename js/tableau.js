Melting is achieved by a very high temperature which is obtained by an electric arc between the workpiece and the electrode. The main functions of the electrode coating are to ensure the stability of the arc and to protect the molten metal from the atmosphere. with the gases created during the decomposition of the coating by the heat of the arc. This shielding controls the mechanical properties, chemical composition and metallurgical structure of the weld metal, as well as the characteristics of the electrode." ,

									<h3 class="title_inner">Here is a list of tools that you may need to buy to <strong>start welding</strong>:</h3></br>
									<p>
										1. <strong>Welding machine</strong>: You will need a <strong>welding machine</strong> that is suitable for the type of <strong>welding</strong> you plan to do. There are several types of <strong>welding machines</strong>, including stick welders, MIG welders, <a href="https://www.wallid-guergour.com/blog/welding/GTAW/TIG-welding.html"><strong>TIG welders</strong></a>, and flux-cored arc welders, each of which is best suited for different types of welding.</br></br>
										2. <strong>Welding helmet</strong>: A <strong>welding helmet</strong> is essential for protecting your face and eyes from the bright light and heat generated during <strong>welding</strong>. Look for a helmet with a high-quality lens that provides good visibility and is suitable for the type of welding you will be doing.</br></br>
										3. <strong>Welding gloves</strong>: Welding gloves are important for protecting your hands from the heat and sparks generated during <strong>welding</strong>. Look for gloves made from high-quality materials that are comfortable to wear and provide good dexterity.</br></br>
										4. <strong>Welding jacket</strong>: A welding jacket is designed to protect your upper body from the heat and sparks generated during <strong>welding</strong>. Look for a jacket made from flame-resistant materials that is comfortable to wear and provides good coverage.</br></br>

										7. <strong>Chipping hammer</strong>: A chipping hammer is used to remove slag (the solidified material that forms on the surface of a weld) from the surface of a weld. Look for a hammer with a durable handle and a good grip.</br></br>
										8. <strong>Wire brush</strong>: A wire brush is used to clean the surface of metal before welding. Look for a brush with sturdy bristles and a comfortable handle.</br></br>

									<h3 class="title_inner">How a <strong>craftsman</strong> can use <strong>Linkedin</strong> to create a <strong>professional network</strong>?</h3></br>
									<p>
										As a <strong>craftsman</strong>, <strong>LinkedIn</strong> can be a valuable tool for building a <strong>professional network</strong> and promoting your skills and services. </br>

										Personally, I live in France and the mechanisms are similar to someone who lives in the USA or elsewhere.</br>
										Here, we have a temporary work system called "Interim". Basically we go to agencies, which find us work, a bit like a freelance platform.</br>
										
										I systematically refused all offers of a permanent contract with a company, but I did get a job with every assignment. I gave the best of myself and when I left the company.</br>
										
										I added on <strong></strong>Linkedin the production manager and the workshop manager to build my network.</br>
										
										Here are some tips on how to use LinkedIn effectively as a <strong>craftsman</strong>:</br>
										
										1. Set up a professional <strong>LinkedIn profile</strong>. Start by creating a <strong>LinkedIn profile</strong> that showcases your <strong>craftsman skills</strong> and experience. Add a clear and professional profile photo, and include a summary that highlights your expertise and accomplishments.</br></br>
										2. Connect with other professionals. <strong>LinkedIn</strong> is a great platform for connecting with other professionals in your industry. Use the search bar to find and connect with other craftsmen, as well as professionals in related fields who may be interested in your services.</br></br>
										3. Join relevant <strong>LinkedIn groups</strong>. There are likely a number of <strong>LinkedIn groups</strong> related to your field of expertise. Joining these groups can help you stay up-to-date on industry news and trends, as well as connect with potential clients and partners.</br></br>
										4. Share your work and achievements. Use <strong>LinkedIn</strong> to showcase your work and achievements as a <strong>craftsman</strong>. You can post updates about your latest projects, share photos of your work, and highlight any awards or recognitions you have received.</br></br>
										5. Participate in industry discussions. <strong>LinkedIn</strong> is a great platform for engaging in industry discussions and sharing your insights and expertise. Join relevant LinkedIn groups and participate in discussions, or start your own discussion and see what insights your connections have to offer.</br></br>
										
										By following these tips, you can use <strong>LinkedIn</strong> to build a <strong>professional network</strong> and promote your <strong>craftsman skills</strong> and services. This can help you find new clients, grow your business, and stay connected with other professionals in your industry.</br>
